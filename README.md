PayMinute is a Fintech Company with over 5000 active users located in Nigeria and Kenya.
They currently have Data Analysts whose dailytasks is to deliver analysed data to the department heads and board members weekly.
The analysts have since began to experience delayed data retrieval and need for multiple-checks on data accuracy as their daily transactions grew.
After much complain, the business has decided to adopt the services of a Big Data Engineer.
